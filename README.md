## Go-Url-Shortener

Forked from [didip/shawty](https://github.com/didip/shawty)

This service encodes a given url and stores it into filesystem (base-36) or cassandra (currently UUID). It has 3 features: shorten, unshorten, and redirect.

Differences from original:

* Goa-generated app, client, controller, tools
* Basic Cassandra support
* More... wip
